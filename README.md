# physics-simulation-research

the project is more to a research/testing project rather than a game. The project has minimum game elements in it.

The project was meant to test and research to do a prediction/simulate in the background process using multiple physics scene, where each simulation's result will be compared, and return the best result.

by doing a physics simulation in the background process, we can get more accurate and level-maintainable AI for any physics-based game.

The project shared has a brute-force algorithm in it (where it checks every possible 10 degrees outcome). 
Currently trying more effective algorithm as this is slow.
